## Cat Management

Jack owns so many cats that he can’t keep track of all of them. He needs some way to keep track of all of his cats - almost like a Pokédex for cats. Your app should be able to complete the following tasks:


#### Mandatory

- :heavy_check_mark: Add a new Cat (Name, Breed, Description, or anything else you think would be important);
- :heavy_check_mark: Remove Cats;
- :heavy_check_mark: Edit Cats;
- :heavy_check_mark: List all of his Cats;
- :heavy_check_mark: Map screen showing the location of each cat;
- :heavy_check_mark: Persist data; 
- :heavy_check_mark: Build the Back End using Laravel;
- :heavy_check_mark: Build the Front End using React, VueJS, Angular or the Front End framework you feel comfortable with.

#### Extra

- :heavy_check_mark: Containerize the app.

### Requirements

- Docker-compose:  >= 1.25.0
- Docker:  >= 20.10.12

### Setup instructions

Execute the following steps:

- Clone the project
- Create `.env` file from `.env.example` in back-end folder
- Create `.env` file from `.env.example` in front-end folder
- Run `docker-compose up --build`
- Wait the docker-compose build finish
- Now you can access the application on http://localhost:801/
